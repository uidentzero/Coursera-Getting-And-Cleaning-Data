  Introduction

  This repository contains the course project files for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data."  
  
  It contains:
  
  1. The raw data
  2. A script called run_analysis.R
  3. A tidy data set derived from the run_analysis.R running against the raw data
  4. A code book for describing the tidy set
  5. The recipe used to create the tidy data set from the raw data
  
  

About The Raw Data


About The Tidy Data Set


About The run_analysis.R Script

(This is quoted from course requirements:

"[the] run_analysis.R script:

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity    and each subject.
